This folder contains some small web scraping scripts I have written.

wwdtm-scrape.py finds and downloads episodes of the podcast "Wait Wait Don't Tell Me" from NPR for a specified date range. I wrote this to automate the downloading process so we could have all the episodes to listen to on a long road trip.

astrid_scrape_func.py uses the webiste redditsearch.io to find and download a set of pictures posted to Reddit.
